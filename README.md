# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

There is a images/ directory and all referenced image files (backgrounds, logos, icons). Without this directory background images and icons will not load, breaking the layout and navigation visuals.
